    The date input component consists of three grouped text fields that invite users to enter a day, a month, and a year.  This is the easiest way for users to enter dates they know well.

<p>Interact with each example to see how it works.</p>

    <Example  code={components__Date[0]} iframeProps={{

<h2 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it</h2>
<p>Use the date input component when you&#39;re asking users for a date they&#39;ll already know, or one they can look up easily.</p>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use-it">When not to use it</h2>
<p>Do not use the date input component if users are unlikely to know the exact date of the event you&#39;re asking about.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>The three fields in the date input component are grouped together in a <code>fieldset</code> with a <code>legend</code> that describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. The legend is usually a question, such as &#39;What is your date of birth?&#39;.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re asking one question per page, you can set the contents of the <code>legend</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.</p>
<p>Never automatically move focus between the fields of the date input because this can confuse users and may clash with normal keyboard controls.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-autocomplete-attribute-for-a-date-of-birth">Use the autocomplete attribute for a date of birth</h2>
<p>Use the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute on the date input component when you&#39;re asking for a date of birth. This allows browsers to autofill the information on a user&#39;s behalf if they&#39;ve entered it previously.</p>
<p>To enable this functionality, set the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute on the fields to <code>bday-day</code>, <code>bday-month</code>, and <code>bday-year</code>. You&#39;ll need to do this to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</p>

        height: 270
      }}></Example>

<h2 id="error-messages">Error messages</h2>
<p>Style error messages as shown in the following example.</p>
<ExampleContainer>
    <ExampleHeading>Error</ExampleHeading>
    <Example  code={components__Date[3]} iframeProps={{
        id:"iframe_componentsDate3",

      }}></Example>
</ExampleContainer>

<p>Write a specific error message for every possible error state.</p>
<p>When setting up errors, check the entire date as a whole, rather than separately checking the day, month, and year.</p>
<p>Avoid assuming what is wrong with the date entered. For example, if a user enters &#39;31 2 2016&#39;, the day may be right and the month may be wrong. An error message that mentions February may be confusing if they meant to enter &#39;1&#39; in the month field.</p>
